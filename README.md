# Vue3-Vite-Express
This is a basic project scaffold for a frontend with Vue 3 and Vite, and a backend with Node and Express.

## Vue 3 and Vite
This frontend scaffold contains most of the stuff you'll need to get started building a Vue 3 project, including:
  - Vue3-Mq for easy responsive breakpoints
  - Pinia for state management
  - Axios for API Calls
  - uuidV4 for creating unique IDs
  - Vue3-Cookies for cookies
  - Argon2 for scratch authentication
  
 ## Express
 This is a web backend you can use as an intermediary between your frontend web client and your backend microservices. It includes everything you need to get started:
  - CORS with a config file to get you started
  - Express-session middleware to send session cookies if needed
  - Axios for API calls to your backend microservices
  - MySQL2 if needed (you can change this to fit your choice of database)
  - MySQL Session Store (again, you can change if you use a different database)
